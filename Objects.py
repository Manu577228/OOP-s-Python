# An object is an instance of a class â€” it is the actual implementation based on the class blueprint.
# Each object holds its own state (attributes) and can use the class's methods.

# You create an object by calling the class like a function: obj = ClassName().
# Multiple objects of the same class can hold different data.
# Each object can access and modify its own data.

   def __init__(self, brand, year):
