# Overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
# It enables custom behavior in the child class while reusing the structure of the parent class.

# Used in inheritance.
# If a method with the same name exists in both parent and child, the childâ€™s version is called.
# Helps in extending or customizing the base class behavior.
